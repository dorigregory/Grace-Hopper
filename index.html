    <p>  Besides playing outdoors, she also learned crafts such as needlepoint and cross-stitch. She enjoyed reading and learned to play the piano.
        Hopper liked to tinker with gadgets and find out how they worked. At age seven she was curious about how her alarm clocked worked. But when she took it apart, she was unable to put it back together.

     <h3> Education</h3>
     <p> Walter wanted his girls to have the same opportunities as his boy. He wanted them to be self-sufficient.  
         Grace Murray Hopper attended private schools in New York City where the curriculum focused on teaching girls to be ladies.
          She had to be a boarding student for a year until she was able to enter Vassar at age 17 in 1923. She couldn't enter Vassar College earlier, at age 16, because she failed the Latin exam.
         In 1928 she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College with degrees in mathematics and physics. In 1930 Hopper received her master’s degree in mathematics from Yale.

     <h3> Joining the Navy</h3>
      <p> 
          Grace Hopper was 34 years old when she was trying to join the military. But she was considered too old and underweigh. But she pursued trying to obtain a spot in the military. She had to get a waiver, for being underweight for her height, and attempted to join the military. It paid off, she was sworn into the U.S. Navy Reserve in December 1943. 
      </p>
      <p>Hopper’s talents as a teacher also helped her communicate with a wide variety of audiences—technical experts, engineers, business leaders, data processors, young people, and the general public. She helped persuade business clients of the value of adopting new technologies
